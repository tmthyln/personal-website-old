# A Human Analysis of the FIRST Robotics Competition
A final project for UMD's *CMSC320: Data Science* course.

This project will be evaluated for the following qualities:
* **Motivation.** Does the tutorial make the reader believe the topic is relevant or important (i) in general and (ii) with respect to data science?
* **Understanding.** After reading through the tutorial, does an uninformed reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the topic feel like s/he learned more about it?
* **Other resources.** Does the tutorial link out to other resources (on the web, in books, etc) that would give a lagging reader additional help on specific topics, or an advanced reader the ability to dive more deeply into a specific application area or technique?
* **Prose.** Does the prose portion of the tutorial actually add to the content of the deliverable?
* **Code.** Is the code well written, well documented, reproducible, and does it help the reader understand the tutorial? Does it give good examples of specific techniques?
* **Subjective evaluation.** If somebody linked to this tutorial from, say, Hacker News, would people actually read through the entire thing?
