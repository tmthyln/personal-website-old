# Personal Portfolio of Past and Present (and Potentially Pondering) Projects
This website (built off this repo, see dev branch) contains a portfolio of miscellaneous projects and things I've done, from significant school projects to teaching notes to side projects to one-off mathematical tangents.

Built with Franklin.jl.
