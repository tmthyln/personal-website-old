# Personal Portfolio of Past and Present (and Potentially Pondering) Projects
This website contains a portfolio of miscellaneous projects and things I've done, from significant school projects to teaching notes to side projects to one-off mathematical tangents.

Originally built with Vue, then converted to Nuxt, but Javascript-based was abandoned in favor of a simpler yet powerful Franklin/Julia-based generator.

Built with Franklin.jl.
